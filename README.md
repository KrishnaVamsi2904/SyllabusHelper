# SyllabusHelper
Users can ask questions about syllabus in natural language and get answers. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) framework has been adopted with ChromaDB as the vector store, nomic-embed-text as the embedding model and Gemini 1.5-Pro as the large language model. Streamlit has been used to create a simple user interface.
